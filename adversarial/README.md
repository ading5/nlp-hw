This homework is about writing questions that are interesting and that
a reasonable human could answer but that computers struggle to answer.

Tools to Write Your Question
=======

Here are some techniques to write questions systems cannot answer:

You can see a previous competition we ran here:

You are free to download/use any QA systems you'd like or to use them on the web.  Some ideas include:
* https://you.com/
* https://www.bing.com/new
* https://chat.openai.com/
* https://www.llama.com/
* https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/
* https://aistudio.google.com/

Please share any good ones you find with the rest of the class.

Format of the Question
========

You'll create two kinds of questions:
 * One will be pyramidal, since this is the format we've been using for all of the course projects.
 * The other will be multiple choice (MC), which is the format we'll use for the final exam.
 
You are welcome to share information between the two (i.e., you can turn your
multiple choice question into a pyramidal question).

There are many reasons why MCQA isn't great, but everybody (especially us) uses it because it's easy to grade.

How to describe your question
=========
A question requires about a page of explanation with the following subsections:

* _Question_: The question you asked, why you thought the question is difficult for computers while not as hard for the humans, why you chose this specific topic to ask a question about. If it is pyramidial, why choose to do so?
* _Guess_: What answer systems provided (make sure to provide details on what systems you tried against). The details may include why you chose this answer system.   
* _Answer_: What the correct answer should be.  Provide sources with citations.  Wikipedia should not be used as a primary source.  Better sources are peer-reviewed articles (JSTOR is your friend and is available from UMD IPs without a fee), newspapers, books (Google books is good), etc.
* _Guess Explanation_: Why did the AI provide the answer that it did? Connect it with why you chose this particular answer system and if the guesss it gave matches with your intent of making the question difficult. For the
homework, this can be in general terms (but do make use of concepts like
semantic/syntactic ambiguity that we've covered in class), but for the project
this should be backed up with relevant citations from the NLP literature. 
* _Interesting/Notability_: Why would someone find this question interesting
or why would someone want to know the answer to this question?  Use citations
as relevant/necessary.  Possible explanations are: surprisingness (Brian May
from Queen has a PhD), novelty (John Tyler is the earliest former
President of the US with a living grandchild), importance (the Witting
reaction is taught in most organic chemistry classes), or connective (Samuel
Beckett drove Andre the Giant to School).

There's an example of this in this directory.  The citations do not count against the page limit, and it's okay to go slightly beyond a page.

Use of ChatGPT
========

Just so there are no mixed signals, you're allowed (and encouraged) to use
ChatGPT and other AI tools to check your work.  However, don't try to use them
to generate questions or explanations (it probably won't work).  In general,
adhere to the policy articulated here:
https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/ACL-2023-policy/

What Can you Write Questions About?
=========

You can write a question about anything.  We care more about the quality of
the question than the topic.  If it tests a skill that humans have that
computers lack, that's fine.  That said, your classmates will try to answer
these questions, so don't make it too obscene, difficult, obscure, or
annoying.  You will get more points for questions that are fun and a pleasure
to answer.

If you're at a loss, we strongly encourage you to write a question about the
contents of the course.  That's something you now know a lot about (as does
everyone in the class), so that will be a good topic for the final exam.

Groups
=========

You can work in groups for this assignment, but it doesn't decrease the
workload (e.g., if you're N people, you must submit N pyramical questions and N multiple choice questions).  Everyone
will get the same score for their submission, and if late days are used it
will be applied to all members of the group.

Question Security
==========

Do not share your questions with members of the Maryland Academic Quiz Team
(present or past) who are not members of the class without explicit permission
(they---along with course staff---will be our humans evaluating the quality of the questions).

What to turn in
==========

Turn in both a PDF of the writeup of your question and a json including the
raw text of the question and answer to Gradescope. Both examples of both
writeup and the json file are included in this directory.

There should be one tossup and one bonus for each member of the group.

How do I know if I have a Good Question?
==========

You should make sure that your teammates / roommates / family can answer the
question (without knowing the answer).  You only get one chance to test a
question for the first time, so don't waste it.  

Grading
==========

You will lose points if your question is:
* Vague
* Has incorrect information
* Has incorrect grammar
* Makes it seem like it's asking for two different things
* Is a near copy of an existing question

You will lose points if your answer is:
* Too obscure for anyone to know

Good questions will get full points if:
* The question is difficult with an accessible answer
* Clue-dense
* Reward knowledge
* Have specific facts
* Stump computers
* Are answerable by any reasonably-informed humans

Writeups will get full points if they:
* Cite all facts in the question with good (i.e., not Wikipedia) references
* Clearly explain why they structured the information and the pyramidality
  

FAQ
===========

*Q:* Can I submit more questions?

*A:* No, submit your best questions.  However, you will probably need to write many bad questions before you manage to write a good question.

*Q:* What humans should be able to answer the question?  Is it okay if it's hard?

*A:* At the minimum, a skilled trivia player should be able to get the question right.  However, it's even better if more people can get the question right.  The easier the question is for an average human (let's assume American undergrad for the purposes of this exercise), the more impressive it is that a computer cannot answer it.  

*Q:* Do I have to use a Wikipedia page title as the answer?

*A:* Normally yes.  It helps to standardize and will also let us link it to resources.  However, some of the answers are not going to be in that set.  E.g., if you want to have an answer like "missing a leg" or "ways Sean Bean has died in films" or "because they're all dead", that's not going to match a page.  Please try to match if you can, but otherwise, an arbitrary string is fine.

*Q:* Can the answer be a year or a number?

*A:* Yes, but these questions are often difficult to write so that they're uniquely identifying.  For events that are ancient history, there's often debate about when something happened.  And there are different calendar systems.  You you'd need to specify something like "Based on the Greogorian calendar".  You also need to be specific about if you want a year, a day, a month, etc.  There's also sometimes confusion about when something happened: battles can last days, elections are voted on in November but someone isn't sworn in until the following January.  So all of this is to say, it's okay to ask this, but it sometimes requires more care.

Also, humans don't memorize a lot of dates.  Some things are tightly tied to dates (coronation of Charlemagne, Pearl Harbor, September 11), but most things are not.  So if we're looking for things that humans can answer but computers cannot, these sorts of things may be more difficult.

*Q:* What computers should ~not~ be able to answer the questions?

*A:* It's okay if some computers can't answer the questions.  But clearly it would be better if all computers cannot answer the question.  Even better is if they all fail in different ways.  We're not going to focus on particular systems and say that, for instance, it must absolutely stump ChatGPT.
